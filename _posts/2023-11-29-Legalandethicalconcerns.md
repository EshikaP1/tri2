## Popcorn Hack #2
If a person copies and earns $2,500 from plagairized work what legal reprecussions could they face? Would they face fines or prision sentences, and for how long?

# Copyright and Intellectual Property

Copyright is the legal right that the creator of a work has to it. The WIPO defines two types of rights under copyright:

- **Economic Rights:** rights to financial benefits from the use of the work
- **Moral Rights:** rights that aren't financial, but are still important. For example, the right to claim authorship or the right to prevent harmful changes.

Copyright is not a new concept. Copyright laws have been around since the 18th century. However, the digital age has created new challenges to copyright and demands new ways to protect it as well.

Before you use or repost content from the internet, you have to consider copyright. Just because a piece of art or an image can be easily found on the internet doesn't mean that it's free to use, especially not if you're turning a profit.

Check what the copyright license is on all online content before you use it. Some pieces of content require permission from the creator before being used. Some pieces aren't allowed to be used for financial purposes. Even if this isn't the case, you should always cite any material you use that you didn't create as good practice.

Using content created by someone else without permission or citation can have consequences, such as a fine or an order to remove copyrighted content.

If you claim the said content was your own, even unintentionally, you might be found guilty of plagiarism.

## Plagiarism

Plagiarism is when you take the content of someone else and claim it as your own. The most common type of plagiarism students hear about is the plagiarism of written ideas and/or phrases. It's possible to accidentally plagiarize by simply forgetting to cite the original source of an idea or phrase.

Plagiarism can have serious consequences, especially in the world of academia. It can get students expelled and see the careers of professors destroyed. Furthermore, there could be legal consequences as well.

It's not difficult in the age of image searches and Turnitin.com to be caught plagiarizing or violating copyright. It can also be incredibly disheartening for content creators to see their hard work taken without permission or credit.







## Homework


1. Describe the key differences between the Creative Commons Zero v1.0 Universal, Open Source MIT License, and Open Source GPL License.

2. Give examples that illustrate how companies, such as Qualcomm and Red Hat, have leveraged Open Source licenses to establish unique business models.

3. Why are businesses that heavily rely on Open Source software still need to generate income and how they manage this within the constraints of Open Source licenses.


# Extra Credit 

Explain the significance of choosing an appropriate license for personal and team GitHub repositories, especially for the CPT project. How does this relate to the broader themes of legal and ethical concerns in computing?
