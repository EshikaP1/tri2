# Notes from AP Classroom video
- Essential Knowledge
    - Material created on a computer is the intellectual property of hte creator or the organizaiton
        - whatever you make on a computer is yours, or the property of your organization
    - Ease of Access and distribution of digitized information raises intellectual property concerns regarding ownership, value, and use
        - How easily information is found online makes ownership rights kind of complicated (a lot of people just kinda take it and yea:)
    - Measures should be taken to safeguard intellectual property.
        - we need to protect our online info
    - If you take someone else' work as your own, this is illegal bc it is plagarism
    - to legally use other ppl's stuff, you can ask the maker, who has the right to give u their work if they want
