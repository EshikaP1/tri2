    "# SASS Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is Sass?**  \n",
    "Short for Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets, SASS is a popular CSS pre-processor. SASS code is processed by the program and compiled into CSS code, which can be used to style HTML elements. SASS controls how it appears on the web page. It is compatible with all CSS versions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## SCSS vs CSS\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is CSS?**  \n",
    "CSS is a computer language for laying out and structuring web pages (HTML or XML). For example, it is used to alter the font, color, size, and spacing of your content, split it into multiple columns, or add animations and other decorative features.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is SCSS?  \n",
    "It is basically more advanced than CSS. SCSS assists a user in adding various extra features to the CSS, such as nesting, variables, etc. These extra features make the process of writing the SCSS language quicker and easier as compared to that of writing the standard language of CSS.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Nesting\n",
    "\n",
    "Nesting helps your code be more organized and easier to read. It is the action of putting one selector inside another selector.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Modular SCSS\n",
    "\n",
    "Using Modular SCSS enables you to divide your SCSS files into several pieces and compile them into a unified CSS file. For this to work, you just need to add an underscore (_) before the filenames.scss so that it gets compiled into its own file. Once you've added the underscore before the file name, you can import it into your file without the underscore, and all the styles will come along. The advantage of using a partial is that it allows you to break down the code for multiple components in larger websites. This way, you can easily organize and make changes to components using these separate files instead of dealing with one massive file.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Benefits of SASS over traditional CSS\n",
    "- **Improved code organization:** SASS offers enhanced code organization through features like nested rules and modular imports, promoting a more structured and readable stylesheet.\n",
    "- **Maintainability:** SASS facilitates easier maintenance with variables, mixins, and functions, reducing code redundancy and making updates and changes more efficient.\n",
    "- **Advanced features:** SASS provides advanced features such as variables, mixins, inheritance, and logic operators. This allows for more dynamic stylesheets than CSS."

    "\n",
    "# Advanced SASS\n",
    "SASS stands for Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets. It is compatible with CSS and makes the CSS in a file more readable and efficent. For example, instead of having multiple CSS code cells throughout your webpage, you can have a page full of SASS that codes for the entire website. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Operators \n",
    "Operators are similar to Python syntax and help SASS users perform various operations on different variables. For example...\n"
